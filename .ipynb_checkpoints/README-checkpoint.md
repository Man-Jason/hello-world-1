CMPINF0010 Jupiter project


## WHAT IT DOES
This code asks for a name and age. It then takes this inputs and prints out a statement that says: "your name is *input* and you are *input* years old. 

__USE__
## HOW TO INSTALL YOUR SOFTWARE 
Open a new terminal in JupyterHub and paste in https://github.com/Mirla03/hello-world.git and press the enter key. 
This should download a notebook called hello-world that has the software called 0010Lab.ipynb. 

## HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE
The software, once ran, will ask for an input of the users name. Once responded to, it will prompt another input that asks for the user's age. Once both are responded to, the output will print the inputs in a sentence together. 

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Go to the repository hello-world on the user "Mirla03" on and press "Fork" in the top right hand corner. After that, press "Create fork" at the bottom.
Once your fork loads, click the green "Code" button toward the top right, copy the link to the repository, and run "git clone <paste repository link here>" (remember that your username should be somewhere in this URL because it's your fork of the repository)
Enter the directory of the repository with "cd <name of the repository>", and make your changes inside this folder.
Once your changes are done, from inside the repository directory (the text directly to the left of the dollar sign should be the name of your repository) run "git add ." which will stage all of the files in your directory to be included in the next commit.
Run 'git commit -m "<some message describing your changes>"' but MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MESSAGE. There have been some issues with commits that do not have a commit message.
Run 'git push origin main' to upload the changes in your fork to the GitHub repository. If you get the "403" error, it means you either entered the wrong token/username or are trying to make changes to the original repository (not the fork). In that case, copy your work to a safe location, delete the repository, clone your fork instead, copy your work back into the repository folder, and then repeat from step 4.
Go back to the GitHub webpage for your fork of the repository. You'll see a little banner below the green "Code" button that says something like "This branch is <some number of commits> ahead of <the repository name>." To the right of that, click "Contribute" and then "Open pull request".
Write a little description for what you did in the box that says "Leave a comment" if you like.
Press "Create pull request"
After sending your pull request, the owner of the file will review it and pull it to the main as a contributer commit.
