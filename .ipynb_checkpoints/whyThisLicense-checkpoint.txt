I went with the license I did because I believe that this code is very flexible and straightforward where it can be changed and also copied exactly without "stealing" an idea. It is also not a very intricate code that we did that needed a lot of rules. In the writing of it, I considered what was important from the code and tried to come up with what people could do with it. This is why I allowed them to be able to do whatever they wanted with it. I just had to play with the formatting to make it look more professional.
